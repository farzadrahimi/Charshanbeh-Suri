Chaharshanbeh Suri is one of the Iranian traditions and festivals celebrated from the evening of the last Tuesday of Esfand (the final month of the Persian calendar) until after midnight on the last Wednesday of the year. Its main characteristic is lighting fires and jumping over them. This festival is the first of a series of Nowruz celebrations and observances, held collectively in open spaces with fire lighting and other symbolic rituals.
